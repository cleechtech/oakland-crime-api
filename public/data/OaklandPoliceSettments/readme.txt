A version of this Read Me was first published as How We Analyzed Our Police Officer Data on 4/02/2014 at http://oaklandpolicebeat.com/2014/04/how-we-analyzed-our-police-officer-data, This document was last updated by Abraham Hyatt on 4/08/2014.

The Oakland Police Beat Officer Dataset was reported and compiled by Abraham Hyatt, Rin Kelly and Laura McCamy with additional assistance by Kevin Rychel and Kelly Baker.

The data in this file was taken from records supplied by the Oakland City Attorney's office with 1,368 lawsuits and complaints filed against the Oakland Police Department between Jan. 1, 1990 and Feb. 14, 2013 that the city settled out of court. Using City Council reports we identified similar settlements made between Feb. 15, 2013 and April 1, 2014. Using City Attorney settlement reports and state and federal court documents, we identified 417 cases that involved alleged civil rights violations. 

We used City Attorney records, PACER and both physical and digital documents from the Superior Court of Alameda County to identify officers named in the civil rights-related cases.

We only included officers who were explicitly named in court documents. We did not include officers who were removed from a case prior to it being settled. We made every effort to not include officers who were named in civil rights lawsuits but who were accused of non-civil rights violations. When there was a discrepancy in how officer names were spelled between our various sources of data, we used the spelling found on payroll records and employment lists provided by the OPD.

Data Sources
Oakland City Attorney: all case settlement data, including the city’s internal identification number for the case, court case number, dollar amount awarded to the plaintiff, court filing date, plaintiff name or names, plaintiff lawyer or lawyers, and case summary.
US District Court, Northern District of California; Superior Court of California, Alameda County: case summaries, officer names
Oakland Police Department: officer name spellings

The information in our databases comes directly from official court and city documents. Because of that, it may contain errors made by record keepers in the federal and state courts, the City Attorney’s office, and the police department. Please contact Oakland Police Beat Editor Abraham Hyatt if you feel there is a problem.

Limitations
City’s problems with data: When the City Attorney supplied us with the settlements dataset we found seven civil rights-related cases where plaintiff names from one case had been transposed with another. After we caught those mistakes, the city gave us new data. It contained misplaced plaintiff names as well. Rather than try a third time, we used the case reports the City Attorney sends to the City Council to identify the correct plaintiffs. The city confirmed that the names we identified were correct. We encourage other researchers and journalists who obtain the full 1990-2013 settlement database from the city of Oakland to be extremely cautious when reporting on plaintiff names.

OPD chiefs: We did not include OPD chiefs named in lawsuits in our database. Under the federal civil rights act, police supervisors can be held liable if department policies — including officer training policies — result in the violation of someone’s civil rights. Because of that, chiefs are regularly named in suits even when they did not have direct involvement in an incident. In those cases we chose to focus on individual officers who present at the time of the alleged misconduct.
